              The US Open Tennis Championships is a hardcourt tennis tournament
              held annually in Queens, New York. Since 1987, the US Open has
              been chronologically the fourth and final Grand Slam tournament of
              the year. The other three, in chronological order, are the
              Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon. The US Open starts on
              the last Monday of August and continues for two weeks, with the
              middle weekend coinciding with the US Labor Day holiday. The
              tournament is one of the oldest tennis championships in the world,
              originally known as the U.S. National Championship, for which
              men's singles and men's doubles were first played in August 1881.
              It is the only Grand Slam that was not affected by cancellation of
              World War I and World War II or interrupted by the COVID-19
              pandemic in 2020.
